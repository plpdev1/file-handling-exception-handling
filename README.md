# File Handling and Exception Handling

This project demonstrates how to perform file reading, writing, and basic exception handling in Python. The script reads a file, modifies its content (converts to uppercase), and writes the modified content to a new file. It also handles errors if the file does not exist or cannot be read.

## Files:
- `file_handling.py`: Main script for reading, modifying, and writing to files.
- `input.txt`: Example file to read from.
- `output.txt`: Output file with modified content.
